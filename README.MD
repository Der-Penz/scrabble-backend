#### WS Endpoint

To provided a ongoing connection of server and client to constantly share the game state a WS connection will be established. To join a Scrabble room you connect to the WS Endpoint `/ws/[id]` with the id being the room you want to join. Additionally a name parameter can be added to get a custom name otherwise a random name will be chosen for you.If the custom name is already used you will also get a random one. If no room with the given id is open no connection will be closed.

> For establishing a websocket connection you must use the `ws` protocol instead of `http` / `https`

Example Endpoint:

    ws://localhost:8808/ws/test   or   ws://localhost:8808/ws/test?name=Steve
      
##### Handling communication

* Structure
    - `action` : specific action so you know what to do with the data
    - `message` : payload with data to work with

* Example
    ```json
    {
        "action": "player:joined",
        "message": { "name": "Steve", "host": true }
